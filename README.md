# Kaggle
In this repostory I keep track of all Kaggle projects that I have worked on. 

## Titanic

Classic analysis for the Titanic dataset, using some extra feature engineering and finally an ensemble classifier I rank in the top 5% on kaggle.

## House Prices

Using stacked regressions, among which are XGBoost and LightGBM models.
